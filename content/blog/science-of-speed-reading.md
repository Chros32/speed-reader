Most people read at about 200–250 words per minute. But with the right techniques, you can push well beyond that without sacrificing comprehension. The key is understanding how your brain actually processes text.

## How Your Eyes Read

When you read, your eyes don't glide smoothly across the page. They make rapid jumps called **saccades**, landing on fixation points for about 200–250 milliseconds each. Between fixations, your brain is essentially blind — it's processing what it just captured.

Traditional reading is inefficient because your eyes often jump backward (called **regressions**) to re-read words you've already passed. Studies show that regressions account for 10–15% of all eye movements during reading, and most of them are unnecessary.

## The Subvocalization Bottleneck

Subvocalization is the habit of silently "speaking" words in your head as you read. It's something nearly everyone does, and it caps your reading speed at roughly the speed of speech — around 150–250 WPM.

Here's the thing: you don't need to hear every word to understand a sentence. Your brain can process written language visually much faster than it can process it auditorily. Speed reading techniques work by training you to reduce subvocalization and trust your visual processing.

## Chunking: Reading Groups of Words

Your brain is remarkably good at recognizing patterns. Instead of reading word-by-word, experienced speed readers learn to take in **chunks** of 3–5 words at a time. This takes advantage of your peripheral vision and reduces the number of fixation points per line.

Think of it like this: a beginner pianist plays one note at a time, but an expert reads and plays entire chords. Speed reading is learning to read in chords.

## RSVP: Removing the Need for Eye Movement

Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) takes a different approach entirely. Instead of moving your eyes across text, RSVP displays one word at a time in a fixed position. This eliminates:

- **Saccadic eye movements** — your eyes stay in one place
- **Regressions** — you can't jump backward
- **Line tracking** — no need to find the next line

Research shows that RSVP can help readers reach speeds of 400–700 WPM while maintaining good comprehension, especially for straightforward material.

## The Comprehension Trade-Off

It's important to be honest about the trade-offs. At very high speeds (800+ WPM), comprehension does decline for most people. The sweet spot for most speed readers is **350–500 WPM** — roughly double the average reading speed — with comprehension rates above 80%.

The goal isn't to read everything as fast as possible. It's to have the **flexibility** to adjust your speed based on the material. Skim a news article at 600 WPM. Slow down to 300 WPM for a technical paper. That adaptability is the real superpower.

## What the Research Says

A 2016 meta-analysis published in *Psychological Science in the Public Interest* found that while some speed reading claims are exaggerated, certain techniques — particularly those that reduce regressions and improve focus — do produce meaningful speed gains with acceptable comprehension trade-offs.

The takeaway? Speed reading isn't magic, but it is a trainable skill backed by real cognitive science.

## Start Training Today

The best way to improve your reading speed is consistent practice with gradual progression. Start at a comfortable speed, push slightly beyond it, and let your brain adapt. Tools like Read Fast use RSVP to make this process structured and measurable.

Your brain is capable of much more than you think. You just need to train it.
